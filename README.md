# Person Re-Identification via Deep Learning
Person re-identification (re-ID) is the technique of correlating photos or videos of the same person captured from various perspectives and cameras. It has immense societal applications in our day to-day life like video surveillance, culprit identification etc. Despite this, it has always remained a difficult process even with the recent progress, due to the significant differences in human looks from various capture angles.

Therefore, we have proposed an end-to-end approach to tackling the problem by learning feature representation and distance metric together, by which similar samples will be kept closer together and dissimilar samples will be pushed farther away. This results in a low-dimensional embedding space where person images can be nonlinearly mapped. We also developed the suggested technique using the inception architecture, tested it on re -ID data sets, and compared them with our current state of the art methods.
